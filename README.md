# Just Store Executive Dashboard 

## Overview
This project presents an executive-level Tableau dashboard built to analyze store performance using core commercial KPIs and regional/category breakdowns.  
The dashboard is designed to support fast, data-driven decisions by summarizing customer activity, order volume, sales, profit, and quantity with clear visuals and filters.

- **Orders:** 296

## What This Dashboard Answers
- Which regions drive the most sales?
- Which product categories contribute the most revenue?
- How do sales and profit compare across categories?
- How does performance trend over time?
- How do filters change executive insights?

## Visual Highlights
- **Sales by Region** (bar chart)
- **Sales Distribution by Category** (pie chart)
- **Sales & Profit by Category** (comparative bars)
- **Sales Trend Over Time** (time-series)
- **Interactive filters** for Region and Year of Order

---

## Key Insights 
- The **West** region leads sales by a wide margin.
- **Technology** appears to be the top revenue category in the current view.
- Sales show clear monthly fluctuations, suggesting seasonality or campaign effects.
- Comparing **sales vs profit by category** supports quick margin-focused decision-making.

## Business Recommendations
1. **Defend and grow the West region**
   - Maintain inventory strength and service levels in the West.
   - Test regional upsell bundles or premium offerings where demand is already proven.

2. **Fix the gap in weaker regions**
   - Use targeted promotions or localized campaigns in lower-performing regions.
   - Review distribution, delivery speed, and product availability in those areas.

3. **Improve category profitability**
   - Use the Sales vs Profit view to identify categories with high sales but weaker margins.
   - Reassess pricing, supplier costs, and discount depth for those categories.

4. **Plan for seasonality**
   - Align inventory, staffing, and marketing with peak sales months.
   - Run pre-peak campaigns to smooth stock demand and avoid shortages.

5. **Strengthen Technology performance**
   - If Technology remains top in most filter views, expand accessory bundling,
     warranty offers, or cross-category recommendations to increase margin per order.
